Education
======
* M.S. in Electrical Engineering (Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Controls), University of California - San Diego, 2024
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering (Machine Learning and Controls), University of California - San Diego, 2023

Work experience
======
* NASA
* RoboCoach
* Amazon Robotics
* Takeda
  * Served as the primary liaison between Takeda and the vendor for transitioning the facility from preventative to predictive maintenance.
  * Scheduled sensor installation, coordinating between the vendor and manufacturing teams to minimize production disruption.
  * Collaborated with departments to secure necessary approvals for temporary shutdowns, enabling smooth sensor deployment.
  * Contributed to a proposal for expanding predictive maintenance, securing funding for additional sensor installations in another building.
  * Highlighted operational redundancies to stakeholders, demonstrating the facility's ability to maintain production during sensor installation and potential equipment failures.
  * Performed a comprehensive cost analysis, clearly outlining the financial and operational benefits of adopting predictive maintenance practices.

* SpaceX - Intern (July 2020 - October 2020)
  * Developed and optimized the manufacturing process of solenoid valves to accelerate production and increase quality.
  * Increased production volume by 114% (from 70 to 150 valves/day).
  * Introduced two new steps in the assembly process to decrease assembly time (grease plating/poppet).
  * Root caused two major waves of valve failures that led to approximately 60 valves failing per day (swage tool/retainer cap/poppet).
  * Generated a step-by-step corrective action document for technicians to rectify production losses due to test failures.
