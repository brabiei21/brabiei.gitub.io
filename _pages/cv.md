Education
======
* M.S. in Electrical Engineering (Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Controls), University of California - San Diego, 2024
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering (Machine Learning and Controls), University of California - San Diego, 2023

Work experience
======
* NASA
* RoboCoach
* Amazon Robotics
* SpaceX
  * Developed and optimized the manufacturing process of solenoid valves to accelerate production and increase quality.
  * Increased production volume by 114% (from 70 to 150 valves/day).
  * Introduced two new steps in the assembly process to decrease assembly time (grease plating/poppet).
  * Root caused two major waves of valve failures that led to approximately 60 valves failing per day (swage tool/retainer cap/poppet).
  * Generated a step-by-step corrective action document for technicians to rectify production losses due to test failures.


* Takeda
